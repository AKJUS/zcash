Notable changes
===============

Network Upgrade 6.1
-------------------

The code preparations for the Network Upgrade 6.1 consensus rules are finished and
included in this release. The following ZIPs are being deployed:

- [ZIP 271: Deferred Dev Fund Lockbox Disbursement](https://zips.z.cash/zip-0271)
- [ZIP 1016: Community and Coinholder Funding Model](https://zips.z.cash/zip-1016) (partially)

NU6.1 will activate on testnet at height **3,536,500**, and can also be activated
at a specific height in regtest mode by setting the config option
`-nuparams=4dec4df0:HEIGHT`.

As with previous network upgrades, it is possible that backwards-incompatible
changes might be made to the consensus rules in this testing phase, prior to
setting the mainnet activation height. In the event that this happens, testnet
will be rolled back in v6.10.0 and a second testnet activation will occur.

See [ZIP 255](https://zips.z.cash/zip-0255) for additional information about the
deployment process for NU6.1.

Fixed Orchard bug in transparent balance APIs
---------------------------------------------

Several RPC methods inherited from Bitcoin Core internally rely on
`CWalletTx::IsFromMe` for detecting involvement of the wallet in the input
side of a transaction. For example:
- The `getbalance` RPC method uses it as part of identifying "trusted"
  zero-confirmation transactions to include in the balance calculation.
- The `gettransaction` RPC method uses it to decide whether to include a
  `fee` field in its response.

When Orchard was integrated into `zcashd`, this method was not updated to
account for it, meaning that unshielding transactions spending Orchard notes
would not be correctly accounted for in transparent-specific RPC methods. A
similar bug involving Sprout and Sapling spends was fixed in v4.5.1.

Updates to default values
-------------------------

- The default for the `-preferredtxversion` config option has been changed from
  `4` (the v4 transaction format introduced in the 2018 Sapling Network Upgrade)
  to `5` (the v5 transaction format introduced in the 2022 NU5 Network Upgrade).
  Use `-preferredtxversion=4` to retain the previous behaviour.
